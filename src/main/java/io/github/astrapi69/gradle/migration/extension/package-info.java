 * This package provides utility classes for working with Gradle project dependencies and Git
 * repositories. The functionalities include:

 * <li>Managing and transforming Gradle dependencies, including retrieving dependencies content from
 * a build.gradle file, converting project names between naming conventions, and generating
 * dependency-related structures for Gradle projects.</li>
 * <li>Interacting with Git repositories, such as adding files to Git, unstaging files, and checking
 * the status of a repository using shell commands.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The classes in this package are designed to facilitate the migration and maintenance of
 * Gradle-based projects, particularly when dealing with version management and source control
 * operations.
